1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is very convenient for a team project.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
By pulling changes manually we can be sure that each commit represent a logical step.
